          PROMPT="Now I'll give you the code (actually it's just a diff), your task is to find all the vulnerabilities and flaws in it that you can find. Report each vulnerability only if you are SURE that it is indeed a vulnerability. Accompany each item with a markdown block with an example code that would fix this problem, if you can think of one. So, here's the code:"
          RESPONSE=$(ollama run hhao/qwen2.5-coder-tools:0.5b "$PROMPT\n$(gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER)")
          gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "$RESPONSE"
